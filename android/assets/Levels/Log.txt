Magnets Game (No name yet)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Possible Themes
1.	Typical minimalist styles (dark backgrounds, bright red and blue magnets, smooth animations)
	a.	Level boundaries would be better off the same for every level
2.	Underground cave context (Escaping a cave?)
	a.	Probably fits the metal blocks and magnets stuff better
	b.	Need to research on the scientific accuracies (at least some accuracy is needed)
	c.	Can have a rogue-like feel then. Combine with dungeons style
	d.	Like this ^, but with no diagonals (perceived depth in terms of graphics only). Actually, the style should be like a top down view version of Spelunky. Thinking about giving it a retro feel. 
	e.	Could have enemies that roam around (and possibly even push stuff)

Possible Level Designs
1.	Fit-within-screen?
a.	Doesn’t fit well with underground cave context (Need much bigger space)
2.	Extensive (Procedural)
a.	Fits the underground cave context. We can probably go with randomly generated rooms and then mix it up with dungeons.

Problems:
1.	Ambiguity, since we are using a level maker to make levels. What if you put 4 magnets of the same pole in a pattern of a 2x2 square?
a.	As in, though at the start of each level, all magnets should be stationary. 
b.	But this is necessary for completeness
2.	Will the magnets move diagonally in some context? Is it even supposed to move diagonally?
a.	Given a single-block magnet that is in contact with 2 single-block magnets of the opposite pole
3.	What happens when you try to shift magnets that are held together by unlike poles?
a.	What happens when a certain magnet cannot be moved in that direction while the one you are pushing can? (Probably just split back into two groups – We are not talking about permanently lumped together magnets)

Possible changes in mechanics (and aims)
1.	Magnets cannot be a single block
2.	Blocks of iron which can be magnetised (behaving as extensions of magnets?)
3.	A level of literally any shape and size (Not having to be like the bomberman level layout)
4.	Magnets affect neighbouring 8 blocks
a.	Can two blocks be diagonally attracted to each other?

1. When drawing pixel art, determine the size of the sprite in the game first, then draw it out. If not, you might get a sprite which the details will be muddled if you zoom out. 

2. Sharp corners, uniformness and abstract-ish style is recommended unless you can draw retro pixel art pretty well.

3. Taking reference from Hyper Light Drifter (Art style). Thinking about what type of art style this should be. And perspective as well. Should it be Top Down View? Or Diagonal (See 3 sides of an object)? Or Boxhead (Only see 2 sides of an object: Top and side. Angle is 45)? Or Hyper Light Drifter (Isometric on Z and X axis. The 2 visible sides of the object is almost the same size and perspective)?

# Made a Top Down View of a lodestone. (Wanted colour scheme: Partially Oxidised Metallic Grey)
Sigil generated by inputing LODESTONE at http://sigilscribe.me/

@ Lodestones are blocks that will be attracted to a magnetic source 1 block away (1 block of empty space between). When magnetised, they behave as an extension of the ____ and would attract other magnetic blocks or magnets. When the magnetic source is cut off, all those blocks revert back to normal immediately. (No residue!)

	L M    =>       LM		M L M	=>	M L M
	123            123 		12345		12345		
	  (1 block away)		(In between 2 sources)		

	3  L		3  L		3  			2 L		2  L
	2  	=>	2 	=>	2  L			1 XM   =>	1 XM
	1 L M		1  LM		1  LM			  12		  12
  	  123		  123		  123		(Diagonal attraction - (X dictates a wall))
		(Chain reaction)

?0 Problem: What happens when a lodestone is near 2 magnetic sources that forces it to go diagonal? Will this game allow diagonal movement?

	3 L M		3   M		2 Lm		
	2 	=>	2  L?		1 m 	=>	???? (m are magnetic fields)
	1 M		1 M		  12		(Should snap to grid be used?)
	  123		  123

Look at 12/05/2016 for continuation

@ Lodestones will be present in any shape, but the most common would be 1x1, 1x2 and 1x3. 

?1 In real life, a metal block when in contact with a magnet, does the same thing but can it repel things?

! A lodestone in this game would be a block capable of being magnetised.
! The introduction levels would not involve repulsion yet. A focus on magnetising and attraction is taken instead.

?2 Regarding the levels, now I want it to be procedurally generated and probably not level based anymore. So, this brings us to a stand-still - what sort of aim should this game have? We can make sprawling levels in a level set, with a certain story I guess. 

! Some idea that is similar to that Goof Troop game: You can bring certain blocks from a room to another room. This might pose a big headscratcher to many people. 

?3 Possible story intro: Some guy trapped in this underground city and to escape he needs to solve puzzles and blah blah. Possibly some lore?

# Made a Top Down View of a magnetic source. Intended for it to not have poles or anything yet, though the sigil in the middle of the block is generated by inputing MAGNETIC SOUTH at http://sigilscribe.me/

@ Magnetic sources as shown on the previous log entry, are immovable units that is also a section of the floor. It will attract blocks on a 5x5 radius. Look at ?0 (Continued). 

?0 (Continued). Probably the best way to handle the ambiguity given those scenarios is to completely ignore blocks that are diagonal of it. It can only attract blocks that are at most 2 blocks away in North, South, East West direction. 

# Made a section of the floor. *The design is intended to be really simple. No sigils. That's because I'm sticking to a sort of ancient city floor sort of thing. (Reference: Hyper Light Drifter again)

4. The confusing thing about pixel art is probably the same for all art ever. What it looks like in your thoughts will probably turn out really shitty in art form, and it really does. Maybe more practise is required.

5. Draw the outlines first? (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/11259067791395159/?from_navigate=true: Note that this is for highly detailed pixel art, like Street Fighter type. NOT suitable for this game now that I realize) 

6. How many colours do I really need? (If its pixel art, you can have 2-3 colours or up to the full range if you want the colours to blend)
I created a palettes file to keep track of the colours I used and arranged them such that every colour will be present in a straight like with other colours (No colour is standalone. )

7. Which colours should I pick for them to avoid clashing with each other? (You can decide on some general colours. Then generate a color palette or gradient bar to get the correct colours)

8. How to shade? (Transition between the darker corners to the main part to the brighter corners)
Look up Dithering.
Shading with 2 colours (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/268527196508967360/)

! Important: The graphics are designed as if the lighting is 100%. Therefore, we need environment overlays / lighting / ambience.

?0 (Continued). Another problem: Since blocks can be above a magnetic source, if multiple lodestone sare attracted to the same magnetic source at the same time, which one will make it to the centre? This is yet another ambiguity. One solution: Make it such that all blocks stop once they are directly beside the magnetic source, and they become magnetised.

	5   L		5   		5
	4    		4   L 		4
	3 L M L =>	3  LML		3
	2   		2   L 		2
	1   L		1		1 
	  12345		  12345		  12345

! A lodestone block is more strongly attracted to the closest magnetic source. Meaning, once it is in contact with another magnetic source, it should not move anymore regardless of other magnetic sources near it (but not next to it)

! When the lodestone block is moving towards the magnetic field via attraction. It should accelerate from a very low speed and stop abruptly at the final position (though the animation should not be too slow as well). The stopping animation may require a new graphic (tilted block)

! Needs dust animation when blocks are moving. And when crashing into walls. 

! Should have a unpushable lodestone block (different graphics) that can only be moved via attraction. 

@ Players can push blocks over magnetic sources. Some blocks may result in a temporary nullification of the magnetic properties. 

?4 (and ?2) Right now we have a basic idea on how the blocks should look like. Now here comes the UI. Well, the "player bar". Should this game show only the playing field? Are there supposed to be items, and if so, are they cumulative? Is there a health bar? Are there enemies in the game? If this game is intended to be mostly puzzles, how will it fit into the dungeon theme? (See next point)

!! We could make this game such that it looks like a dungeon -- the entrance and exit of each level are connected like rooms in a dungeon -- but in fact, the connections between each adjacent rooms are actually levels in our game. Possible very fast panning across the levels that the user has conquered when continuing from the start screen or replaying of levels. 

! Needs a new set of blocks. Buttons, levers and doors. Buttons can only stay down when a block is on it. Levers gets pushed down upon contact with the player and stays down. 

! Decided to use the 2D perspective look (Like Hyper Light Drifter / Kwirk : http://www.nerdshit.de/wp-content/gallery/kwirk/kwirk-er-ist-verw-irre-nd-gameboy_2.jpg)
Should I choose a 100:50 ratio in depth? (Cuboid but artstyle is drawn with 100 pixels for top view and 50 pixels for side view)

?1 (Final). Turns out that an iron block in contact with a magnet cannot possibly repel another iron block or magnet. It can only attract. 

?5 We can even have branching rooms. <Think about it next time>

?6 There should be at least 30 levels before the introduction of another feature?

# Realized that 100x100 pixel art is too big for this game (Phone game). Changed to 50x50. 

# Created a simple buttons graphics (Supposed to overlap with the ground graphics).

@ In a room, all buttons must be pressed down for a door to open

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

16/05/2016

# Designed some levels featuring both movable and non-movable lodestones, floor magnetic sources, buttons and doors. 

?0 (Final). There is still a problem involving ambiguity so I've added a simple rule. When in ambiguity, don't move. You can think of the mechanics as all floors have a grid that allows lodestones to slide, and hence it can't move diagonally if it wanted to. 

	3 L M		3 L M		3 L M		3 L M		3   M		3   M
	2	=>	2   		2  x	=>	2  x		2 	=>	2   L
	1 M		1 M 		1 M		1 M		1 M L M		1 M   M
	  123 		  123		  123		  123		  12345		  12345

# MEETING:
Regarding depth in this level, we wanted it to be like Hyper Light Drifter. You can walk up or down stairs and you would still be able to see the whole map. Basically, its just setting a depth variable to a tile, and generating graphics based on the depth. Its ok, because our graphics are tilable. 

@ How about this? Starting would be an underground city theme (overgrown), then gradually moving onto areas with more open air, and finally reaching thee outskirts of that city.

! Some steps for making pixel art. http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/42648699708/pixel-art-tutorial
1. Sketch. On paper.
2. Draw an outline.
3. Clean the outline.
4. Colour it without gradient. Just solid colours
5. Add gradient. Consider lighting as well. Define the position of the light source. Add soft shadows, then highlights.
