IDEAS

Boulder. 

	Blocks that can be pushed, just like the lodestone.
	For this special type of boulder, it is much easier to be pushed.
	Therefore, if there are multiple boulders in a row, the player can push all of them at once.
	Possible ambiguity: If a lodestone lies at the end of that chain, should the player still be able to push the boulders along with the lodestone?
	
Bonfire.

	Lights up adjacent tiles.
	A barrier to the player, but not to blocks.
	Any object that gets pushed over on top of it will extinguish it.
	
Hinged Walls.

	Reference: Kwirk.
	A multi-tile wall with different states (orientations). 

Doors / mechanisms that open as long as they are magnetized.

When a block is magnetized, the door opens.

Blocks against a wall open doors.
	
RANDOM

The floor under any object at the start of all levels should be slightly darker to indicate that they have been there for quite long. (Change floor placement algorithm)
